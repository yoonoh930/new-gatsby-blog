#### Why am I doing this?

---

Writing is important. It helps crystallyze what’s in your mind. It can be also a source of new ideas as well as a way to reinforce what you’ve thought and learned. A Chinese proverb goes by

> The faintest ink is more powerful than the strongest memory.

Also, I tend to start working on subjects without considering their context and its consequences thus resulting wasted time and effort. I hope, by working on a blog, I get to develop the [second-order thinking](https://fs.blog/2016/04/second-order-thinking/) as well as better documented learning and progress in general.



#### What is this blog about?

---

This blog will be about lots of things. Mostly, it will be about journal of things I am currently working on personally. Posts will be about programming in general, science, and rants, definitely.
