There are tons of service that provide means to writing on internet. You can post on medium, make your own site using Blogger, Wordpress and Wix. There are convenient and you can focus only on writing, which is not what I am looking for myself. I would like a blog that I can later add custom functionalities and web apps. I wold like to connect to maybe flask for personal project, or D3.



#### What functionalities do I want?

So far, what I considered minimum constraints are:

* Be quick to set-up
* Be cheap to host
* Be flexible for add-ons

I read numerous articles about self-hosted blog doing some researches about front-end, back-end and servers. Throughout the course, My initial intention of hosting my own blog changed after coming across with GatsbyJS. Lots of terms to learn and it was a bit overwhelming to do researches on terms such as *JAM stack*, *headless CMS*, *decoupling*, *static page*, etc. at once but this is what I’ve learned so far for reasons to use GatsbyJS for my blog.

* Very fast
* Amazing documentation
* Tons of plugins
* ReactJS

It takes some time to build but after the building phase, since everything is converted as markup lanaguge, transferring data even in the region with not-so-fast internet connection becomes breeze. Some people interested in adding interactive graphs, custom maps or script might step back, but as this [blog post](https://janosh.io/blog/gatsby-interactive-plots) shows, you can add an interactive graph using MDX. Also, there are plugins for other scripts such as D3, google map, etc in the official website, not to mention you can make your custom plugin since GatsbyJS is based on ReactJS.

Apart from its techonical advantages, the biggest selling point is that anyone can host for free on Netlify. I will have to buy a custom domain, but that shouldn’t be a problem.

There is also something called CMS. The non-abbrevated version of the term is content management system. There are some open source and free CMS but I wonder myself, do I really need it? It seems that they are mostly for collaboration focusing on contents with ease of editting after initial set-up. This blog is not planned to be written by multiple authors and future posts might include custom script so the blog will be created without any CMS for the moment.



#### What’s the process?

---

Building a website is completely unknown territory. All the programmings I’ve done are hobby projects that use python. Because I am not familar with this matter, I had to do some research and thanks to how well GatsbyJS is made and its amazing ecosystem, it’s relatively simple.

1. Build a blog with Gatsby in the local computer
2. Upload on GitHub
3. Connect GitHub with Netlify and deploy

One thing to note that is that even if I am not familar with building a website and its stacks, I will still try to learn. Even if there are tons of great themes to use for starters, I am going to start from a bear bone and add extra stuffs.

Let’s start building
