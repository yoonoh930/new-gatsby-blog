## Basic Git Manipulation

### Branching

Create a new branch and switch to the branch

```bash
$ git checkout -b branchName ## -b creates branch

## This is shortcut for
$ git branch branchName
$ git checkout branchName
```



### Merging

The branch you are in gets merged into from the branch you specify

```bash
$ git checkout theBranchToBeMergedInto
$ git merge theBranchToMerge

## After done with the branch, you can delete it
$ git branch -d theBranchToMerge
```



### Recording Changes

Files are divided into the following categories:

1. Untracked
2. Unmodified
3. Modified
4. Staged



And you commit staged files.



```bash
## Add files to Git
$ git add theFile

## Commit the staged file
$ git commit -m "Message"
## Or commit an item after skipping adding phase
$ git commit -a -m "Message"
```
