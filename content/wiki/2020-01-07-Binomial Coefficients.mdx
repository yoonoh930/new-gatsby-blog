## Definition

Assume $m \geq n$ are nonnegative integers
$$
\binom{m}{n} := \frac{m!}{n!\,(m-n)!} = \dfrac{m(m-1)(m-2)\cdots 3\cdot 2\cdot 1}{(n(n-1)\cdots 3\cdot 2\cdot 1)((m-n)(m-n-1)\cdots 3\cdot 2\cdot 1)},
$$

## Example

For example, let's say there are 8 people and you want to make a group of 3 people. Since the order doesn't matter, you can use binomial coefficients for this situation:
$$
\binom{8}{3} =\frac{8!}{5!\,3!} = 56
$$
