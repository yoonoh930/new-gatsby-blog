How to do bootstrap in R



Bootstrap in R requires a function that accept replaced samples as input and yield statistic of interest



## Estimating the Accuracy of a statistic of interst

From *Introduction to Statistical Learning with Application in R*



Let's say that there is a `Portfolio` dataset with two financial assets that yield X and Y. We want to invest $\alpha$ fraction into X and Y. The goal is to minimize the risk, or variance, of the investment. by choosing good value of $\alpha$ So it will be:
$$
Minimize: \:\:\:\: \text{Var}(\alpha X + (1 - \alpha)Y)
$$
Wrangling the equation leads to:
$$
\alpha = \frac{\sigma_Y^2 - \sigma_{XY}}{\sigma_X^2 + \sigma_Y^2 - 2\sigma_{XY}}
$$
So, in R, this would be

```r
alpha.fn <- function(data, index) {
  X = data$X[index]
  Y = data$Y[index]
  return((var(Y) - cov(X,Y))/(var(X)+var(Y)-2*cov(X,Y)))
}

boot(Portfolio, alpha.fn, R=1000) # Does bootstraping 1000 times
```



## Estimating the Accuracy of a Linear Regression Model

Boostraping can be used to asses variability of coefficients and predictions from different models.

```r
# Using Auto data
boot.fn=function(data, index)
  return(coef(lm(mpg ~ horsepower, data = data, subset = index)))
boot(Auto, boot.fn, 1000)
```
