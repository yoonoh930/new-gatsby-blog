## The Function and the Library

Fitting polynomials as well as step function doesn't require special library.  There are a few ways to polynomials and for the step function, we can just use `cut()` function on predictors.



## Different ways of fitting polynomial regression.



```R
fit <- lm(y ~ poly(x, power), data=data)
fit <- lm(y ~ poly(x, power, raw=T), data=data)
fit <- lm(y ~ x + I(x^2) + ... + I(x^power), data=data)
fit <- lm(y ~ cbind(x, x^2, ... , x^power), data=data)
```

They all have same prediction. There is `raw=T` paramter for the `poly` function. `poly()` without `raw=T` returns a matrix of orthogonal polynomials, which means that each column is a linear combination of a power of the variable. This is done so that each part captures the part that was not captured by the previous column.



### How to find the appropriate power.

There are two ways to find which power to use for polynomials: ANOVA and Cross-Validation.

For ANOVA, models M1 and M2 must be nest models: predictors of M1 must be subset of M2. Then check p-value from the result of the following:

```R
fit.1 <- lm(y ~ x, data=data)
fit.2 <- lm(y ~ poly(x, 2), data=data)
anova(fit.1, fit.2)
```

Cross-Validation can be checked from its own wiki page.



## How to fit step function

We can simply use `cut()` function

```R
fit <- lm(y ~ cut(x), data=data)
```
