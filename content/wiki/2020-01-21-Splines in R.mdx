## The Function and the Library

We need `splines` library as well as `bs()` function to generate entire matrix of basis function with default of cubic and `ns()` function for natural splines. For the smooth spline, `smooth.spline()` is used to fit and `loess()` for the local spline.



## Basic Usage

### Basis function and natural spline

```R
#With basis
fit <- lm(y ~ bs(x, knots=knots, degree=3), data=data)
fit <- lm(y ~ bs(x, df=df, degree=3), data=data)
#With natural spline
fit <- lm(y ~ ns(x, knots=knots, degree=3), data=data)
fit <- lm(y ~ ns(x, df=df, degree=3), data=data)
```

Note that for cubic spline, when there are 3 knots, the input degree of freedom is 6 because the total of 7(3 for x, x^1, x^2, 3 for 3 knots and 1 for intercept) - 1 degree of freedom consumed by the intercept.



### Smooth Spline

We use `smooth.spline()`. For the function, we feed `x` and `y` separately.

```R
fit <- smooth.spline(x, y, df=df)
fit <- smooth.spline(x, y, cv=TRUE) #CV
```



### Local Regression

For the local regression, we use `loess()`. We have to feed `span` value.

```R
fit <- loess(y ~ x, span=span, data=data)
```
